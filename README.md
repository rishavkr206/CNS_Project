# CNS Project

Welcome to the CNS Project repository!

This project is an implementation focused on concepts from Computer Network Security (CNS), using HTML, Python, and CSS. It is designed to demonstrate practical applications of network security principles, protocols, or tools, and can serve as a learning resource or a foundational base for further development.

## Project Overview

The CNS Project provides a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing network security concepts. It includes web-based interfaces and Python scripts to simulate, analyze, or secure network communications.

## Features

- Interactive web UI for network security tasks
- Python scripts for backend logic and network operations
- Demonstrations of various CNS concepts (e.g., encryption/decryption, authentication)
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** — For the web interface and UI layouts
- **CSS** — For styling and responsive design
- **Python** — For backend logic, simulations, and network operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- A web browser
- (Optional) A virtual environment for Python dependencies

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishavkr206/CNS_Project.git
   cd CNS_Project
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If a requirements.txt file exists)*

4. **Run the application:**
   - If there is a main Python script (e.g., `app.py`), run:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Open the HTML files in your browser, or follow additional instructions in the respective Python/HTML files.

## Usage

- Interact with the web interface for demos and practical exercises.
- Run backend scripts for specific network security operations.
- Explore code to understand the implementation of various security mechanisms.
